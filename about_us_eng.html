                    <h3>Vision</h3>
                    <p>The Deer & Daisy, named after the landscape animal and flower of Skåne, is going to be a classic Country Inn inspired by the traditional English village pub.A comfortable and welcoming establishment with good food and drink, welcoming athmosphere and great company. Open year round it will be the natural meeting place for both visitors and residents in and around Kivik.
                    </p>
                    <p> We are building the business step by step from the ground up. We've had the dream of the little country pub for a long time but the real journey started in 2019 when we found the perfect location.

                    <h3>About The Deer & Daisy</h3>
                    <p> For anyone not familiar with the English village pub it might be hard to imagine what we have in mind. Let us try to describe it and see if you think it sounds nice. It's not a sports bar, there are no betting machines or plasma TV, no loud music but rather focus on conversation and community. You stop by for a while with the dog on the evening walk, or have a glass of wine with your colleagues before drifting off home for the weekend. On Sundays you have a traditional Sunday Roast for lunch and when the rain and wind is whipping up a storm on a cold November night you nip in for a hearty meal by the fire.</p>
                    <p>The Deer & Daisy is first and foremost a meeting place for the good folks of Kivik, which means we will be open year round. The scope is small with space for about 20 diners at a time. The menu is uncomplicated and genuine, tailored to the seasons and local produce. Good beer from local breweries is must as well as a great selection of alcohol free beer and other light beverages.</p>
                    <p>A real Village Pub celebrates all its communities important milestones and traditions. There are a great number of local festivals and traditions in and around Kivik that we are looking forward to adding our touch to. At Christmas and New Year we'll provide an open door for those who want and need to find company and good cheer outside of the home. And we'll be open for bookings for birthdays, afterwork, annual meetings and other social events.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>One of the most important aspects of the village pub is that it's accessible. It should be located where people live, work and conduct their business. It should be visible and recognisable to passers by and become a regular meeting place. We have been very careful to choose the perfect location for the kind of business we would like to run.</p>
                    <p>Accessibility also means that everyone, independent of ability, shoud have easy access and a comfortable time with us. Everyone is welcome and there must be no barriers to enjoying the life and times at The Deer & Daisy.</p>    
                    <p>A village pub must be accessible to those who don't drive. It shouldn't be hidden behind a large car park but surrounded by beatiful flower arrangements, ivy and lushious greenery. The village pub should be a local beauty spot. Many people who move to places like Kivik want to be able to leave the car at home and find their entertainment around the corner, not in some far away city center that they may have just moved away from.</p>
                    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                    <p>Considering our current challenges to a sustainable society it's important that businesses like The Deer & Daisy are built on a sustainable and robust concept. Both from an environmental and financial perspective we want to run a sustainable Village Pub that can afford to be small scale and serve it's community all year round. That's why we're starting small and will only grow at a pace that is in harmony with the rest of Kivik. </p>
                    <p>Recycling and minimising waste are key objectives, as is collaboration with all the fantastic food producers all around Österlen. Together we boost each other and create local jobs and growth for our community.</p>

                    <h3>Building on Good Cheer</h3>
                    <p>In a classic Village Pub everyone knows the landlady. It's not an anonymous owner but an active citizen who gets to know her guests. The pub is aware that it serves its community and that it can only prosper if it contributes to an attractive local scene where people want to take part. Kivik already has many great establishments that attract visitors and provide much needed recreation to the residents. Together we will create a social climate that allows more people to be seen and heard and feel welcome here.</p>
                    <p>The summer is short in Sweden but eh rest of the year is all the longer. This gives us a chance to be there for each other and create meeting places and opportunites to lighten each others' load. If we've learnt one thing in the past couple of years it is that enforced isolation and a limited social life is a great challenge to most people. It must be seen as an incredibly important job to create opportunities and context for people who live close to each other to find strength and purpose in that community. We'd like to do our part in that. </p>
